If, when viewing readonly files in vim, you wish that up/down arrows behaved like in web browser (each down arrow scrolls the view 1 line down, except near end of file; each arrow-up scrolls the view 1 line up, except near beginning of file) 
-- then this plugin does it.

To check the difference, just source the script (':so ro_positioning.vim' if not installed) and try the help (:he) and
try arrows down. You'll notice that up/down arrows behave more conveniently. 

This plugin remaps arrow-up and arrow-down in readonly files to behave more conveniently. No remappings are done for non-readonly files.

If you want to enable this mode for arbitrary writable file, do:
     :set ro
     :e
